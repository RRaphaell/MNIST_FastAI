# MNIST_FastAI
This is one of the most popular and basic competitions from kaggle which is called MNIST digit recognition written using the FastAI library.<br>
I was surprised by how simple and powerful it is. 
With just a few lines of code, I reached 99.5 % on the leaderboard

I highly recommend taking FastAI the course because it focuses more on practice and it will fill any gaps you didn't remember or didn't study.

In addition, I created a visualization of the model using Gradio. 
Gradio is a tool for visualizing demos that is very straightforward and simple to use for this type of thing
